# Machine Learning, Deployment a simple nn with 3 layers to classify moon set dataset

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying a simple short nn for binary classification.
It is a simple 3 layes nn (2 hidden layer) to classify a moonset dataset.

### Project

These cose contains of model,train and predict py. It runs on python 3.6 and assumes that pytorch, pandas and numpy are installed in your environment.

model.py : model definition
train.py  :  training and saving moel
predict.py : implementation of prediction

## Instructure
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	
	```	
		git clone https://github.com/kondra50/moonset_classification_pytorch.git
		cd moonset_classification_pytorch.git
