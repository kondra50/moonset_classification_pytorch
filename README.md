# Machine Learning, Deployment a simple nn with 3 layers to classify moon set dataset

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying a simple short nn for binary classification.


### Project

A simple 3 layes nn (2 hidden layer) to classify a moonset dataset.

## Instructure

These cose contains of model,train and predict py. It runs on python 3.6 and assumes that pytorch, pandas and numpy are installed in your environment.
